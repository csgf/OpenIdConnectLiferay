# OpenId Connect for Liferay

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fmarco76/OpenIdConnectLiferay.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fmarco76/OpenIdConnectLiferay)

OpenId Connect for Liferay is a very rough but effective implementation of the
OpenId connect protocol for Liferay. Using this class it is possible to authenticate
with any OpenId proider specified in the code.

*Note: this code is a proof of concept and in the future the code for OpenId connect will
be integrated in the portlet [federated-login-ext](https://github.com/csgf/federated-login-ext)
which already includes SAML based protocols. The advantage is that the portlet
will provide a configuration panel where the provider and other useful information
can be configured.*
