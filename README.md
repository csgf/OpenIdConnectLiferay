OpenId Connect for Liferay is a very rough but effective implementation of the
OpenId connect protocol for Liferay. Using this class it is possible to
authenticate with any OpenId proider specified in the code.

*__Note__: this code is a proof of concept and in the future the code for OpenId
connect will be integrated in the portlet
[federated-login-ext](https://github.com/csgf/federated-login-ext) which
already includes SAML based protocols. The advantage is that the portlet will
provide a configuration panel where the provider and other useful information
can be configured.*

For the installation instruction and other information have a look at [the
documentation](docs/index.md).
